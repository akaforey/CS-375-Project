# Huffman Coding
This repo implements the Huffman Coding algorithm using two different methods.

The algorithm is used for compression, and it is especially useful when there is a skewed distribution of symbols or words to compress. The most common symbols get a short representation, while the least common symbols get a longer representation.


### Usage
Compile using "make"
Run using "./huffman input.txt" where "input.txt" is replaced with the name of the input file
The output will print the tree generated for each
